* Makers Academy week 10 (tech test week).

* My solution to the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata, originally created by Terry Hughes and translated into Ruby by Emily Bache (https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).   

* The idea is to refactor an effective but almost unreadable body of code so that it can be easily modified.  The code has to update the value of various items according to different specifications.  You're allowed to change anything except the 'Item' class.  

* I created a full set of RSpec tests before I started refactoring, in order to check that my refactored code still did the job.  

* I then borrowed and adapted the Golden Master Spec from Artur Trzop ( http://blog.lunarlogic.io/2015/what-ive-learned-by-doing-the-gilded-rose-kata-4-refactoring-tips).  This checks for edge cases by comparing expected and actual outcomes if `update_items` is run one hundred times.
